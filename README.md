# Knight Fall

## Objective

Our objective was to create a fun experience in the form of an Role Playing Game. Our game is called KnightFall. The user will be brought into our medievil world with their choice of character and then taken along through the journey with story and battles.

## Purpose 

Our purpose is to entertain our player and bring joy to all that play

## Process

We split up into two teams front-end and back-end. After planing out our flow for the game we started by working separately. We eventually came together to connect everything and polish our final project. 

## Goals

Our first goal for the future is to make the game responsive and progressive for all mobil devices. We also want to polish our Log-in feature to make sure our users can leave the game and then pick back oup where they left off. 

We would also love for our users to be able to buy items for their character using their game points. 

We also have plans to expand the story for even more game play.
